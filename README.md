The RickerTuningFit repository is a collection of functions and codes to excecute the Ricker wavelet fitting on physiological or behavioral data to model tuning functions. The tuning functions modeled by the Ricker wavelet are generated/modulated using generalization learning paradigms. However, any paradigm that works with the optimization of the response to a salient stimulus and generated tuning functions can use the Ricker model to fit the data. 
In addition, a Morlet wavelet model is included to compare to the Ricker goodness of fit. A caveat of the Morlet model is that presents difficulties fitting data with few conditions and its results have to be carefully interpreted.
To obtain more details about the application of teh Ricker model, please refere to the manuscript "Quantifying Population-level Neural Tuning Functions Using Ricker Wavelets and the Bayesian Bootstrap"
